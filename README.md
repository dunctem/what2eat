## 1. Introduction

What2eat is an application for restaurant owners enabling them to easily offer a contact-free digital menu for customers. That can also open the door to interactivity opportunities that only the digital world can offer.

  

## 2. Expected List of Features

- Create 2 layout styles, one with images and one without.

- in case the user likes to have pictures of dishes or not

- Create Menu items with sort order and assigned to categories

- That way they will display as the user prefers

- Display menu with pop-up modals for the food items

- Popup modals are an nice way of quickly displaying more information

- Create URL and printable QR code for the menu

- The idea is that the owner will be able to add it to the table/entrance and offer contact free menu.

- Share buttons on every item and on the menu itself

- Calls to action go a long way, this will increase shares/likes

  

## 3. Market Survey

musthavemenus.com

socialtaste.me

postermywall.com

restaurant-menu.net

  

These websites all offer similar menu making services but they are not focused on solving the issue of having to put menus through a sanitation process constantly because of the COVID pandemic.

## 5. Minimum requirements

Assuming you have Git already installed, you will still need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed properly on your computer. I found this [node installation guide for Windows](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/node-windows.html) very useful.

  

## 6. Instructions

To run the test environment follow this **step-by-step** guide.

### Step 1

Open your terminal and clone the git repository with the following command:

  

`git clone https://github.com/dunctem/Nucamp.git`

  

### Step 2

When git has finished downloading the required files, you will need to run the installation script with this command:

  

`npm install`

or

`npm i` for short

  

### Step 3

After the installation process you are now ready to run the testing environment with:

  

`npm start`

  

It will compile for a second or two and launch the server on http://localhost:3000 and automatically open it on your default browser.
